--- abstract

This document describes extensions to existing digital signature schemes for key blinding.
The core property of signing with key blinding is that a blinded public key and
all signatures produced using the blinded key pair are independent of the
unblinded key pair. Moreover, signatures produced using blinded key pairs
are indistinguishable from signatures produced using unblinded key pairs.
This functionality has a variety of applications, including Tor onion services
and privacy-preserving airdrop for bootstrapping cryptocurrency systems.

# Introduction

Digital signature schemes allow a signer to sign a message using a private signing
key and produce a digital signature such that anyone can verify the digital signature
over the message with the public verification key corresponding to the signing key.
Digital signature schemes typically consist of three functions:

- KeyGen: A function for generating a private signing key `skS` and the corresponding
  public verification key `pkS`.
- Sign(skS, msg): A function for signing an input message `msg` using a private
  signing key `skS`, producing a digital signature `sig`.
- Verify(pkS, msg, sig): A function for verifying the digital signature `sig` over
  input message `msg` against a public verification key `pkS`, yielding true if
  the signature is valid and false otherwise.

In some applications, it's useful for a signer to produce digital signatures using
the same long-term private signing key such that a verifier cannot link any two signatures
to the same signer. In other words, the signature produced is independent of the
long-term private-signing key, and the public verification key for verifying the
signature is independent of the long-term public verification key. This type of
functionality has a number of practical applications, including, for example,
in the Tor onion services protocol {{TORDIRECTORY}} and privacy-preserving airdrop
for bootstrapping cryptocurrency systems {{AIRDROP}}. It is also necessary for
a variant of the Privacy Pass issuance protocol {{?RATELIMITED=I-D.privacypass-rate-limit-tokens}}.

One way to accomplish this is by signing with a private key which is a function of the
long-term private signing key and a freshly chosen blinding key, and similarly by producing
a public verification key which is a function of the long-term public verification key
and same blinding key. A signature scheme with this functionality is referred to as signing
with key blinding. A signature scheme with key blinding extends a basic digital scheme with
four new functions:

- BlindKeyGen: A function for generating a private blind key.
- BlindPublicKey(pkS, bk): Blind the public verification key `pkS` using the private
  blinding key `bk`, yielding a blinded public key `pkR`.
- UnblindPublicKey(pkR, bk): Unblind the public verification key `pkR` using the private
  blinding key `bk`.
- BlindKeySign(skS, bk, msg): Sign a message `msg` using the private signing key `skS`
  with the private blind key `bk`.

A signature scheme with key blinding aims to achieve unforgeability and unlinkability.
Informally, unforgeability means that one cannot produce a valid (message, signature)
pair for any blinding key without access to the private signing key. Similarly,
unlinkability means that one cannot distinguish between two signatures produced from
two separate key signing keys, and two signatures produced from the same signing
key but with different blinding keys.

This document describes extensions to EdDSA {{!RFC8032}} and ECDSA {{ECDSA}} to enable
signing with key blinding. Security analysis of these extensions is currently underway;
see {{sec-considerations}} for more details.

This functionality is also possible with other signature schemes, including some post-quantum
signature schemes {{ESS21}}, though such extensions are not specified here.

## DISCLAIMER

This document is a work in progress and is still undergoing security analysis.
As such, it MUST NOT be used for real world applications. See {{sec-considerations}}
for additional information.

# Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

The following terms are used throughout this document to describe the blinding modification.

- `G`: The standard base point.
- `sk`: A signature scheme private key. For EdDSA, this is a a randomly generated
  private seed of length 32 bytes or 57 bytes according to {{RFC8032, Section 5.1.5}}
  or {{RFC8032, Section 5.2.5}}, respectively. For {{ECDSA}}, `sk` is a random scalar
  in the prime-order elliptic curve group.
- `pk(sk)`: The public key corresponding to the private key `sk`.
- `concat(x0, ..., xN)`: Concatenation of byte strings.
  `concat(0x01, 0x0203, 0x040506) = 0x010203040506`.
- ScalarMult(pk, k): Multiply the public key pk by scalar k, producing a new
  public key as a result.
- ModInverse(x, L): Compute the multiplicative inverse of x modulo L.

In pseudocode descriptions below, integer multiplication of two scalar values is denoted
by the \* operator. For example, the product of two scalars `x` and `y` is denoted as `x * y`.

# Key Blinding

At a high level, a signature scheme with key blinding allows signers to blind their
private signing key such that any signature produced with a private signing key and blinding
key is independent of the private signing key. Similar to the signing key, the blinding key
is also a private key that remains secret. For example, the blind is a 32-byte or 57-byte
random seed for Ed25519 or Ed448 variants, respectively, whereas the blind for ECDSA over P-256 is
a random scalar in the P-256 group. Key blinding introduces four new functionalities for the signature scheme:

- BlindKeyGen: A function for generating a private blind key.
- BlindPublicKey(pkS, bk): Blind the public verification key `pkS` using the private
  blinding key `bk`, yielding a blinded public key `pkR`.
- UnblindPublicKey(pkR, bk): Unblind the public verification key `pkR` using the private
  blinding key `bk`.
- BlindKeySign(skS, bk, msg): Sign a message `msg` using the private signing key `skS`
  with the private blind key `bk`.

For a given `bk` produced from BlindKeyGen, correctness requires the following equivalence to hold:

~~~
UnblindPublicKey(BlindPublicKey(pkS, bk), bk) = pkS
~~~

Security requires that signatures produced using BlindKeySign are unlinkable from
signatures produced using the standard signature generation function with the same
private key.

# Ed25519ph, Ed25519ctx, and Ed25519

This section describes implementations of BlindPublicKey, UnblindPublicKey, and BlindKeySign as
modifications of routines in {{RFC8032, Section 5.1}}. BlindKeyGen invokes the key generation
routine specified in {{RFC8032, Section 5.1.5}} and outputs only the private key.

## BlindPublicKey and UnblindPublicKey

BlindPublicKey transforms a private blind bk into a scalar for the edwards25519 group
and then multiplies the target key by this scalar. UnblindPublicKey performs essentially
the same steps except that it multiplies the target public key by the multiplicative
inverse of the scalar, where the inverse is computed using the order of the group L,
described in {{RFC8032, Section 5.1}}.

More specifically, BlindPublicKey(pk, bk) works as follows.

1. Hash the 32-byte private key bk using SHA-512, storing the digest in a 64-octet
   large buffer, denoted b. Interpret the lower 32 bytes buffer as a little-endian
   integer, forming a secret scalar s. Note that this explicitly skips the buffer
   pruning step in {{RFC8032, Section 5.1}}.

1. Perform a scalar multiplication ScalarMult(pk, s), and output the encoding of the
   resulting point as the public key.

UnblindPublicKey(pkR, bk) works as follows.

1. Compute the secret scalar s from bk as in BlindPublicKey.
1. Compute the sInv = ModInverse(s, L), where L is as defined in {{RFC8032, Section 5.1}}.
1. Perform a scalar multiplication ScalarMult(pk, sInv), and output the encoding
   of the resulting point as the public key.

## BlindKeySign

BlindKeySign transforms a private key bk into a scalar for the edwards25519 group and a
message prefix to blind both the signing scalar and the prefix of the message used
in the signature generation routine.

More specifically, BlindKeySign(skS, bk, msg) works as follows:

1. Hash the private key skS, 32 octets, using SHA-512.  Let h denote the
   resulting digest.  Construct the secret scalar s1 from the first
   half of the digest, and the corresponding public key A1, as
   described in {{RFC8032, Section 5.1.5}}.  Let prefix1 denote the second
   half of the hash digest, h[32],...,h[63].
1. Hash the 32-byte private key bk using SHA-512, storing the digest in a 64-octet
   large buffer, denoted b. Interpret the lower 32 bytes buffer as a little-endian
   integer, forming a secret scalar s2. Let prefix2 denote the second half of
   the hash digest, b[32],...,b[63].
1. Compute the signing scalar s = s1 \* s2 (mod L) and the signing public key A = ScalarMult(G, s).
1. Compute the signing prefix as concat(prefix1, prefix2).
1. Run the rest of the Sign procedure in {{RFC8032, Section 5.1.6}} from step (2) onwards
   using the modified scalar s, public key A, and string prefix.

# Ed448ph and Ed448

This section describes implementations of BlindPublicKey, UnblindPublicKey, and BlindKeySign as
modifications of routines in {{RFC8032, Section 5.2}}. BlindKeyGen invokes the key generation
routine specified in {{RFC8032, Section 5.1.5}} and outputs only the private key.

## BlindPublicKey and UnblindPublicKey

BlindPublicKey and UnblindPublicKey for Ed448ph and Ed448 are implemented just as these
routines are for Ed25519ph, Ed25519ctx, and Ed25519, except that SHAKE256 is used instead
of SHA-512 for hashing the secret blind to a 114-byte buffer (and using the lower 57-bytes for
the secret), and the order of the edwards448 group L is as defined in {{RFC8032, Section 5.2.1}}.

## BlindKeySign

BlindKeySign for Ed448ph and Ed448 is implemented just as this routine for Ed25519ph,
Ed25519ctx, and Ed25519, except in how the scalars (s1, s2), public keys (A1, A2),
and message strings (prefix1, prefix2) are computed. More specifically,
BlindKeySign(skS, bk, msg) works as follows:

1. Hash the private key skS, 57 octets, using SHAKE256(skS, 117).  Let h denote the
   resulting digest. Construct the secret scalar s1 from the first
   half of the digest, and the corresponding public key A1, as
   described in {{RFC8032, Section 5.2.5}}.  Let prefix1 denote the second
   half of the hash digest, h[57],...,h[113].
1. Perform the same routine to transform the secret blind bk into a secret
   scalar s2, public key A2, and prefix2.
1. Compute the signing scalar s = s1 \* s2 (mod L) and the signing public key A = ScalarMult(A1, s2).
1. Compute the signing prefix as concat(prefix1, prefix2).
1. Run the rest of the Sign procedure in {{RFC8032, Section 5.2.6}} from step (2) onwards
   using the modified scalar s, public key A, and string prefix.

# ECDSA {#ecdsa}

[[DISCLAIMER: Multiplicative blinding for ECDSA is known to be NOT be SUF-CMA-secure in the presence of an adversary that controls the blinding value. {{?MSMHI15=DOI.10.1007/978-3-319-30840-1_2}} describes this in the context of related-key attacks. This variant may likely be removed in followup versions of this document based on further analysis.]]

This section describes implementations of BlindPublicKey, UnblindPublicKey, and BlindKeySign as
functions implemented on top of an existing {{ECDSA}} implementation. BlindKeyGen invokes the
key generation routine specified in {{ECDSA}} and outputs only the private key. In the descriptions
below, let p be the order of the corresponding elliptic curve group used for ECDSA. For example, for
P-256, p = 115792089210356248762697446949407573529996955224135760342422259061068512044369.

## BlindPublicKey and UnblindPublicKey

BlindPublicKey multiplies the public key pkS by an augmented private key bk yielding a
new public key pkR. UnblindPublicKey inverts this process by multiplying the input public
key by the multiplicative inverse of the augmented bk. Augmentation here maps the private
key bk to another scalar using hash_to_field as defined in {{Section 5 of ?H2C=I-D.irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve}},
with DST set to "ECDSA Key Blind", L set to the value corresponding to the target curve,
e.g., 48 for P-256 and 72 for P-384, expand_message_xmd with a hash function matching
that used for the corresponding digital signature algorithm, and prime modulus equal to
the order p of the corresponding curve. Letting HashToScalar denote this augmentation
process, BlindPublicKey and UnblindPublicKey are then implemented as follows:

~~~
BlindPublicKey(pk, bk)   = ScalarMult(pk, HashToScalar(bk))
UnblindPublicKey(pkR, bk) = ScalarMult(pkR, ModInverse(HashToScalar(bk), p))
~~~

## BlindKeySign

BlindKeySign transforms the signing key skS by the private key bk into a new
signing key, skR, and then invokes the existing ECDSA signing procedure. More
specifically, skR = skS \* HashToScalar(bk) (mod p).

# Security Considerations {#sec-considerations}

<!-- replace these with more rigorous definitions -->

The signature scheme extensions in this document aim to achieve unforgeability
and unlinkability. Informally, unforgeability means that one cannot produce a
valid (message, signature) pair for any blinding key without access to the
private signing key. Similarly, unlinkability means that one cannot distinguish
between two signatures produced from two separate key signing keys, and two
signatures produced from the same signing key but with different blinds. Security
analysis of the extensions in this document with respect to these two properties
is currently underway.

Preliminary analysis has been done for a variant of these extensions used for
identity key blinding routine used in Tor's Hidden Service feature {{TORBLINDING}}.
For EdDSA, further analysis is needed to ensure this is compliant with the signature
algorithm described in {{RFC8032}}.

The constructions in this document assume that both the signing and blinding keys
are private, and, as such, not controlled by an attacker.
{{MSMHI15}} demonstrate that ECDSA with attacker-controlled multiplicative blinding
for producing related keys can be abused to produce forgeries. In particular,
if an attacker can control the private blinding key used in BlindKeySign, they
can construct a forgery over a different message that validates under a different
public key. One mitigation to this problem is to change BlindKeySign such that the
signature is computed over the input message as well as the blind public key.
However, this would require verifiers to treat both the blind public key
and message as input to their verification interface. The construction in
{{ecdsa}} does not require this change. However, further analysis is needed to
determine whether or not this construction is safe.
