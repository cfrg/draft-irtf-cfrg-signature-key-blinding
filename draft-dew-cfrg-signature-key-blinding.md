--- abstract

This document describes extensions to existing signature schemes
for key blinding. This functionality guarantees that a blinded public key and 
all signatures produced using the blinded key pair are unlinkable to the 
unblinded key pair. Moreover, signatures produced using blinded key pairs 
are indistinguishable from signatures produced using unblinded key pairs.

# Introduction

EdDSA {{?EDDSA=DOI.10.1007/s13389-012-0027-1}} is a type of Schnorr signature algorithm 
based on Edwards curves. The specification {{!RFC8032}} describes several variants of 
EdDSA with parameter sets for the edwards25519 and edwards448 curves as described in
{{?RFC7748}}. According to the specification, private keys are randomly generated
seeds, which are then used to derive scalar elements and their corresponding public
group element for signing and verifying messages, respectively. 

Given an EdDSA private and public key pair (sk, pk), any message signed by sk is
linkable to pk. One simply checks whether the message signature is valid under pk.
In some settings, in is useful to produce signatures with a given key pair (sk, pk)
such that the resulting signature is not linkable to pk without knowledge of a
particular witness r. That is, given pk corresponding to sk, witness r, and a 
message signature, one can determine if the signature was indeed produced using sk.
In effect, the witness "blinds" the key pair associated with a message signature.

This functionality is also possible with other signature schemes, including
{{ECDSA}} and some post-quantum signature schemes {{ESS21}}. 

This document describes a modification to the EdDSA key generation and signing
procedures in {{RFC8032}} to support this blinding operation, referred to as key
blinding. It also specifies an extension to {{ECDSA}} that enables the same 
functionality.

## DISCLAIMER

This document is a work in progress and is still undergoing security analysis.
As such, it MUST NOT be used for real world applications. See
{{sec-considerations}} for additional information.

# Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

The following terms are used throughout this document to describe the blinding modification.

- `G`: The standard base point.
- `sk`: A signature scheme private key. For EdDSA, this is a a randomly generated 
  private seed of length 32 bytes or 57 bytes according to {{RFC8032, Section 5.1.5}}
  or {{RFC8032, Section 5.2.5}}, respectively. For {{ECDSA}}, `sk` is a random scalar
  in the prime-order elliptic curve group.
- `pk(sk)`: The public key corresponding to the private key `sk`.
- `concat(x0, ..., xN)`: Concatenation of byte strings.
  `concat(0x01, 0x0203, 0x040506) = 0x010203040506`.
- ScalarMult(pk, k): Multiply the public key pk by scalar k, producing a new
  public key as a result.
- ModInverse(x, L): Compute the multiplicative inverse of x modulo L.

In pseudocode descriptions below, integer multiplication of two scalar values is denoted 
by the \* operator. For example, the product of two scalars `x` and `y` is denoted as `x * y`.

# Key Blinding

At a high level, a signature scheme with key blinding allows signers to blind their
signing key such that any signature produced under the blinded signing key is unlinkable
from the unblinded signing key. Similar to the signing key, the blind is also a private
key that remains secret. For example, the blind is a 32-byte or 57-byte random seed for
Ed25519 or Ed448 variants, respectively, whereas the blind for ECDSA over P-256 is
a random scalar in the P-256 group.

Key blinding introduces three new functionalities for the signature scheme:

- BlindPublicKey(pkS, skB): Blind the public key pkS using the private key skB.
- UnblindPublicKey(pkM, skB): Unblind the public key pkM using the private key skB.
- BlindKeySign(skS, skB, msg): Sign a message msg using the private key skS with the private 
  blind skB. 

Correctness requires the following equivalence to hold:

~~~
UnblindPublicKey(BlindPublicKey(pkS, skB), skB) = pkS
~~~

Security requires that signatures produced using BlindKeySign are unlinkable from
signatures produced using the standard signature generation function with the same 
private key.

# Ed25519ph, Ed25519ctx, and Ed25519

This section describes implementations of BlindPublicKey, UnblindPublicKey, and BlindKeySign as
modifications of routines in {{RFC8032, Section 5.1}}.

## BlindPublicKey and UnblindPublicKey

BlindPublicKey transforms a private blind skB into a scalar for the edwards25519 group
and then multiplies the target key by this scalar. UnblindPublicKey performs essentially
the same steps except that it multiplies the target public key by the multiplicative
inverse of the scalar, where the inverse is computed using the order of the group L,
described in {{RFC8032, Section 5.1}}.

More specifically, BlindPublicKey(pk, skB) works as follows.

1. Hash the 32-byte private key skB using SHA-512, storing the digest in a 64-octet 
   large buffer, denoted h. Only the lower 32 bytes are used for generating the public key.
1. Interpret the buffer as a little-endian integer, forming a secret scalar s. Note that this
   explicitly skips the buffer pruning step in {{RFC8032, Section 5.1}}. Perform a
   scalar multiplication ScalarMult(pk, s), and output the encoding of the resulting point
   as the public key.

UnblindPublicKey(pkM, skB) works as follows.

1. Compute the secret scalar s from skB as in BlindPublicKey.
1. Compute the sInv = ModInverse(s, L), where L is as defined in {{RFC8032, Section 5.1}}.
1. Perform a scalar multiplication ScalarMult(pk, sInv), and output the encoding 
   of the resulting point as the public key.

## BlindKeySign

BlindKeySign transforms a private key skB into a scalar for the edwards25519 group and a
message prefix to blind both the signing scalar and the prefix of the message used 
in the signature generation routine. 

More specifically, BlindKeySign(skS, skB, msg) works as follows:

1. Hash the private key skS, 32 octets, using SHA-512.  Let h denote the
   resulting digest.  Construct the secret scalar s1 from the first
   half of the digest, and the corresponding public key A1, as
   described in {{RFC8032, Section 5.1.5}}.  Let prefix1 denote the second
   half of the hash digest, h[32],...,h[63]. 
1. Hash the 32-byte private key skB using SHA-512, storing the digest in a 64-octet
   large buffer, denoted b. Interpret the lower 32 bytes buffer as a little-endian
   integer, forming a secret scalar s2. Let prefix2 denote the second half of
   the hash digest, b[32],...,b[63].
1. Compute the signing scalar s = s1 \* s2 (mod L) and the signing public key A = ScalarMult(G, s). 
1. Compute the signing prefix as concat(prefix1, prefix2).
1. Run the rest of the Sign procedure in {{RFC8032, Section 5.1.6}} from step (2) onwards
   using the modified scalar s, public key A, and string prefix.

# Ed448ph and Ed448

This section describes implementations of BlindPublicKey, UnblindPublicKey, and BlindKeySign as 
modifications of routines in {{RFC8032, Section 5.2}}.

## BlindPublicKey and UnblindPublicKey

BlindPublicKey and UnblindPublicKey for Ed448ph and Ed448 are implemented just as these
routines are for Ed25519ph, Ed25519ctx, and Ed25519, except that SHAKE256 is used instead
of SHA-512 for hashing the secret blind to a 114-byte buffer and the order of the edwards448
group L is as defined in {{RFC8032, Section 5.2.1}}.

## BlindKeySign

BlindKeySign for Ed448ph and Ed448 is implemented just as this routine for Ed25519ph,
Ed25519ctx, and Ed25519, except in how the scalars (s1, s2), public keys (A1, A2),
and message strings (prefix1, prefix2) are computed. More specifically, 
BlindKeySign(skS, skB, msg) works as follows:

1. Hash the private key skS, 57 octets, using SHAKE256(skS, 117).  Let h denote the
   resulting digest.  Construct the secret scalar s1 from the first
   half of the digest, and the corresponding public key A1, as
   described in {{RFC8032, Section 5.2.5}}.  Let prefix1 denote the second
   half of the hash digest, h[57],...,h[113]. 
1. Perform the same routine to transform the secret blind skB into a secret
   scalar s2, public key A2, and prefix2. 
1. Compute the signing scalar s = s1 \* s2 (mod L) and the signing public key A = ScalarMult(A1, s2). 
1. Compute the signing prefix as concat(prefix1, prefix2).
1. Run the rest of the Sign procedure in {{RFC8032, Section 5.2.6}} from step (2) onwards
   using the modified scalar s, public key A, and string prefix.

# ECDSA

[[DISCLAIMNER: Multiplicative blinding for ECDSA is known to be NOT be SUF-CMA-secure in the presence of an adversary that controls the blinding value. {{?MSMHI15=DOI.10.1007/978-3-319-30840-1_2}} describes this in the context of related-key attacks. This variant may likely be removed in followup versions of this document based on further analysis.]]

This section describes implementations of BlindPublicKey, UnblindPublicKey, and BlindKeySign as 
functions implemented on top of an existing {{ECDSA}} implementation. In the descriptions below,
let p be the order of the corresponding elliptic curve group used for ECDSA. For example, for 
P-256, p = 115792089210356248762697446949407573529996955224135760342422259061068512044369.

## BlindPublicKey and UnblindPublicKey

BlindPublicKey multiplies the public key pkS by an augmented private key skB yielding a 
new public key pkR. UnblindPublicKey inverts this process by multiplying the input public
key by the multiplicative inverse of the augmented skB. Augmentation here maps the private
key skB to another scalar using hash_to_field as defined in {{Section 5 of ?H2C=I-D.irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve}},
with DST set to "ECDSA Key Blind", L set to the value corresponding to the target curve,
e.g., 48 for P-256 and 72 for P-384, expand_message_xmd with a hash function matching
that used for the corresponding digital signature algorithm, and prime modulus equal to 
the order p of the corresponding curve. Letting HashToScalar denote this augmentation
process, BlindPublicKey and UnblindPublicKey are then implemented as follows:
~~~
BlindPublicKey(pk, skB)   = ScalarMult(pk, HashToScalar(skB))
UnblindPublicKey(pk, skB) = ScalarMult(pk, ModInverse(HashToScalar(skB), p))
~~~

## BlindKeySign

BlindKeySign transforms the signing key skS by the private key skB into a new
signing key, skR, and then invokes the existing ECDSA signing procedure. More
specifically, skR = skS \* HashToScalar(skB) (mod p).

# Security Considerations {#sec-considerations}

This document describes a variant of the identity key blinding routine used in
Tor's Hidden Service feature. Security analysis for that feature is contained
{{TORBLINDING}}. For EdDSA, further analysis is needed to ensure this is compliant 
with the signature algorithm described in {{RFC8032}}.

The constructions in this document assume that both the signing and blinding keys
are private, and, as such, not controlled by an attacker. 
{{MSMHI15}} demonstrate that ECDSA with attacker-controlled multiplicative blinding
for producing related keys can be abused to produce forgeries. In particular,
if an attacker can control the private blinding key used in BlindKeySign, they
can construct a forgery over a different message that validates under a different
public key. Further analysis is needed to determine whether or not it is safe
to keep this functionality in the specification given this problem.

<!-- TODO(caw): compare to additive key blinding, which allows one to blind without private information -->
